### Purpose of these templates

The templates in this folder update the [AWS Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) on resources, actions and items centrally through Service Quotas.
Some limits can be increased programmatically and that is done by this stack based on tags on the account object in `organization.yml`.

All of the resources here are based on community resource types that are made available through `005-types`

Some notable resources in this folder:

| Quota/Limit           | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| S3 buckets            | Set the maximum number of S3 buckets the account may contain. This service quota is global (across all regions), the default maximum is 100.                          |
| CloudFormation stacks | Set the maximum number of CloudFormation stacks allowed. This service quota is regional (needs to be set separately for every region). The default per region is 200. |
| DynamoDB tables       | Set the maximum number of DynamoDB tables allowed. This service quota is regional (needs to be set separately for every region). The default per region is 256.       |

Note that for regional limits, the account tags used in the service-quotas.yml template file apply to the `primaryRegion` set up in the  `_parameters.yml` file.

As an example, consider the following account:

```  yaml
TempDevAccount:
    Type: OC::ORG::Account
    Properties:
      Alias: ba-temp-dev
      AccountName: Temporary Development Account
      AccountId: '215869187117'
      RootEmail: aws-temp-dev@bee.awesome
      Tags:
        service-quotas-s3-buckets: 200
        service-quotas-cfn-stacks: 300
        service-quotas-ddb-tables: 300
```
